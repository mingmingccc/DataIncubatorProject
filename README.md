# DataIncubatorProject

For the Project, I apply two plots to take a peak of data.


The age of FIFA 2018 players are right skewness. As usual, older people are not capable to play soccer. However, we can't conclude that older people must have the less ability. I want to apply what I have learned to investigate players information 
and try to find some interesting through the data processing.

As we expect, the histogram of player Overall Rating seem to be symmetric. This is the output variable in this project.
I want to know the base of deriving player overall rating.

I will build a linear regression model to see the relationship between Overall Rating and other attributes.
Also, i will keep updating the procedure of project and put forward new ideas through the process!
